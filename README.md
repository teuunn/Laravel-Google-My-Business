# Laravel Google My Business

Note: To use the Google My Business API you have to apply for access: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XTQc-QEjsE7YrgstyJxbFDnwmhUhBFFvpNJBw3VzuuE/viewform

This is a Laravel ready implementation of the Google My Business PHP Library (v4.4) as provided by Google on https://developers.google.com/my-business/samples/

Please refer to https://developers.google.com/my-business/reference/rest/ for information on how the Google My Business API functions - more useful links are available at the bottom of this document.

## Debugging

I'm putting this above everything else as it's extremely important. The Google My Business Client library doesn't support detailed error responses:
https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/support#detailed_error_responses

So when something goes wrong, you get an extremely unhelpful 400 error message such as `Request contains an invalid argument`.

To get more detailed error messages we need to add the HTTP header: `X-GOOG-API-FORMAT-VERSION: 2` to the request and the error message that gets returned will be a lot more useful.

There isn't a pretty way to do this, but all you need to do is open:

`/vendor/google/apiclient/src/Google/Http/REST.php`

And in the `doExecute` function modify as follows

```php
      $httpHandler = HttpHandlerFactory::build($client);
      
      // Add the header to the request
      $request = $request->withHeader('X-GOOG-API-FORMAT-VERSION', '2');
```

Once you've finished debugging, remove this added line.

## Installation

Run `composer require teuunn/laravel-google-my-business`

Or to install via composer - edit your composer.json to require the package.

"require": {
    "teuunn/laravel-google-my-business": "1.*"
}

Then run `composer update` in your terminal to pull it in.



## Laravel

**Important**: It's highly recommend you use https://github.com/pulkitjalan/google-apiclient to handle the Google Client setup. The code examples further down this document assume you're using this library.

To use this Google My Business package in a Laravel project add the following to the `providers` array in your `config/app.php`

```php
Teuunn\LaravelGoogleMyBusiness\GoogleMyBusinessServiceProvider::class,
```

Next add the following to the `aliases` array in your `config/app.php`

```php
'GoogleMyBusiness' => Teuunn\LaravelGoogleMyBusiness\GoogleMyBusiness::class
```

## Google My Business Discovery document

The Google My Business API discovery document is a JSON document that describes the surface for a particular version of the API. You use the discovery document in conjunction with the Google API Discovery Service.

`mybusiness_google_rest_v4p4.json` has been included with this project for your reference (downloaded from: https://developers.google.com/my-business/samples/)

## Code example
 
(Work in progress)

```php
use Google; // See: https://github.com/pulkitjalan/google-apiclient
use GoogleMyBusiness;


class MyExampleClass
{

    function authRedirect() {

        // Define the GMB scope
        $scopes = [
            'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.business.manage'
        ];

        // Define any configs that overrride the /config/google.php defaults from pulkitjalan/google-apiclient
        $googleConfig = array_merge(config('google'),[
            'scopes' => $scopes,
            'redirect_uri' => config('app.callback_url').'/callback/google/mybusiness'
        ]);

        // Generate an auth request URL
        $googleClient = new Google($googleConfig);
        $loginUrl = $googleClient->createAuthUrl();
        
        // Send user to Google for Authorisation
        return redirect()->away($loginUrl);
    }
    
    function getAccountName(Google $googleClient) {
        $gmb = new GoogleMyBusiness($googleClient);
        return $gmb->getAccountName();
    }

}

```
